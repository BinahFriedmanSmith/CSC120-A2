Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The most difficult part for me was just adjusting to the requirements of Python syntax, since I had only done OOP in other languages. I had one minor error where i put main inside the computer class, and one where i didn't put attributes in the constructor. Overall I didn't really struggle with this one though. My best advice is to comment as you go, so you don't have to go back and add documentation at the end. Doing that is always either confusing or very boring.
